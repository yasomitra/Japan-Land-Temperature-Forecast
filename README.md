# Japan Land Temperature Prediction

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to forecasting Japan's land temperature for the upcoming five months. It leverages a Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model, trained on a dataset spanning 1657 months. The model's effectiveness is underscored by its performance on the test set, where it achieves a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.02.

## Project Objective
The primary goal of this project is to provide accurate monthly temperature forecasts for Japan, using historical temperature data. This predictive capability is crucial for planning in various sectors, including agriculture, disaster management, and tourism.

## Dataset
The dataset encompasses 1657 months of land temperature data for Japan. This extensive dataset serves as the foundation for training the SARIMA model, ensuring that it captures the intricate seasonal patterns and trends over time.

## Model Details
- Model Type: SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average)
- Training Data: 1657 months of historical temperature data
- Performance Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 1.02 on the test set
